Based on the criteria provided I'd say my implementation Exceeds expectations (29 point)
The implementation works for the test cases I used, altough because of time contraints I probably did not cover all the ways it could fail.

Its weakness is the testing, and the many "if mr.hasAborted" statements. For the final release these would obviously be reomoved, however even with them there, the code demonstrates perfect functionality.

The code fully addresses the  proposed design, i.e. it manages to recover information from a failed master such as the 
completed tasks and registered workers and successfully complete the task from there. 

The code is organized and well documented. (all functions provided are documented in both the README and the source code)


P.S. I spent  way too much time on this (~28 hours), so at least A for effort. The concept and workflow was easy to understand, but I had issues effectively implementing testing as mentioned previously.
